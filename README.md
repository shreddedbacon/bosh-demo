## Pre-built Docs
Docs are prebuilt in the `site` directory. You can open the index.html file directly in your browser.

## Render on the fly
You can render the docs in your browser by installing mkdocs and running the inbuilt server

```
pip install mkdocs-material mkdocs pygments
mkdocs serve
```
